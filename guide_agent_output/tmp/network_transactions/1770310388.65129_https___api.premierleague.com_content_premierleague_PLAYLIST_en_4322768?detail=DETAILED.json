js-article__content\\\">\\n\\t    <p>The Premier League is proud to support a new National Literacy Trust and government campaign launched today promoting the varied benefits of reading to young people.</p>\\n<p>The National Literacy Trust have kicked off the National Year of Reading with the \\\"Go All In\\\" initiative, which aims to reverse a worrying decline in people reading for pleasure.</p>\\n<p>Reading among children and young adults has dropped to its lowest level since 2005.</p>\\n<p>Just one in three eight to 18-year-olds enjoy reading in their spare time with teenage boys affected the most. In 2025, just 25 per cent of boys aged 8-18 said they enjoy reading, compared to 39 per cent of girls.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">The government has pledged to invest £5million for secondary schools to purchase books to support and encourage reading amongst their pupils. This comes alongside a £10million investment to ensure every primary school in England has a library.</span></p>\\n<p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson formally launched the campaign on Tuesday at Emirates Stadium, where ex-Arsenal, <a href=\\\"https://www.premierleague.com/en/clubs/11/everton/overview\\\">Everton</a> and Southampton star <a href=\\\"https://www.premierleague.com/en/players/20467/theo-walcott/overview\\\">Theo Walcott</a> was in attendance to offer his support, alongside authors Richard Osman and Nadia Shireen.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">\\\"Reading unlocks so much of children's education, which is why reversing the decline in reading for pleasure must become a national mission,\\\" Phillipson said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">“Through the National Year of Reading and our Plan for Change we are making sure every child and young person has access to a wide range of books, alongside supporting families to make space for shared reading to give children the best start in life.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">“I'm asking families across the country to read together for just 10 minutes a day. It's a simple step that can lay the foundations for strong literacy skills, helping kids to be school ready and on track to achieve and thrive.”</span></p>\\n<p>Clare Sumner, Premier League Chief Policy and Social Impact Officer said: “The Premier League and National Literacy Trust have worked in partnership for nearly 25 years on Premier League Reading Stars, an education initiative that uses children’s passion for football to get them reading.</p>\\n<p>“We are pleased to build on that long-term activity by supporting the Department for Education’s National Year of Reading, using the reach of the League and our clubs to encourage families to use books as a way to connect, learn and have fun together.”</p><div class=\\\"articleWidget full-width\\\">\\n    <div data-d2c class=\\\"embeddable-instagram\\\">\\n        <blockquote class=\\\"instagram-media\\\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTdSIGLDQJS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\\\" data-instgrm-version=\\\"14\\\" style=\\\" background:#FFF;
